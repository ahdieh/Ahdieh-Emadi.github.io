                Overview:Implement an HTML document containing an online evaluation form for CE(Continuing Education) courses offered at a college. A screenshot of the scanned paper based form can be seen on the following page. Make sure to ask the same type of questions even if you edit the wording slightly.
                You can also modify the layout of the form.
                Create a banner containing an image from the college website and create a link from the image to the 
                college website (home page).
                Use colors of your choice on the form and harmonize them with the palette of the chosen college
                website (hint: you do not have to use a yellow background as in the scanned paper form).
                Do all the styling of your form using CSS rules saved in a separate .css style!sheet. 
                Make sure the website and email addresses on the sample form are implemented as hyperlinks that the 
                user can interact with.
